## Introduction

A tool designed to filter out Trackmania2020 maps based on a certain ruleset. Specifically made for Scrapie's Speedmapping cup where users build their own map
within time restriction on a premade template with restrictions. This tool allows the moderators to automate a big portion of the map validation.

## Features

Filter maps based on:
* Identical start / end(s) / checkpoint(s) to template
* Checkpoint count (less, equal or greater than)
* Multilap
* Author time
* Custom items
* Block styles used
... and more!

## Feedback

Feel free to send us feedback!
